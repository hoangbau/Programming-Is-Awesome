## Big Data

### Big Data Distributor
- [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/emr/) - Amazon EMR simplifies big data processing, providing a managed Hadoop framework. 
- [Cloudera CDH](http://www.cloudera.com/) - Second biggest big data distributor in terms of number of users.
- [Hortonworks HDP](http://hortonworks.com/) - Hortonworks' product named Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP) includes Apache Hadoop and is used for storing, processing, and analyzing large volumes of data.

### Big Data Ingestion Layer
- [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) - Kafka™ is used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming apps. 

### Big Data Speed Layer
- [Confluent Platform](http://www.confluent.io/) - The free, open-source streaming platform based on Apache Kafka. Confluent Platform is the best way to get started with real-time data streams.

### Big Data Batch Layer
- [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) - Apache Spark™ is a fast and general engine for large-scale data processing.

### Resource Manager
- [Apache Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org/) - Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual), enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively.

### Distributed SQL Query Engine
- [Apache Impala](http://impala.apache.org/) - Apache Impala is the open source, native analytic database for Apache Hadoop. Impala is shipped by Cloudera, MapR, Oracle, and Amazon.

### Machine Learning
- [Apache Mahout](https://mahout.apache.org/) - The Apache Mahout™ project's goal is to build an environment for quickly creating scalable performant machine learning applications.
